      <li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Always create complex passwords that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Never reuse passwords across different platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Users must enable MFA for an additional layer of security, protecting accounts from unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep Software Up-to-Date:</strong> Regularly update all software, including operating systems, browsers, and applications, to ensure that security vulnerabilities are patched.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Devices:</strong> Use antivirus software and enable firewalls on devices to detect and prevent malicious activity. Always lock devices when not in use and set up device encryption where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Cautious with Personal Data:</strong> Avoid sharing sensitive personal information unless necessary and ensure that communications are conducted through secure, trusted channels (e.g., encrypted messaging services).</li>
      <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive or critical information. Always log out after using shared or public computers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>8.2 Phishing and Social Engineering Awareness</h3>
    <p>Phishing and social engineering attacks are common methods for cybercriminals to steal sensitive information. Users should be aware of the following precautions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recognize Phishing Emails:</strong> Be cautious with unsolicited emails, especially those asking for sensitive information or prompting urgent actions. Check the sender's email address carefully, as phishing emails often come from addresses that look suspicious or are misspelled.</li>
      <li><strong>Do Not Click on Suspicious Links or Attachments:</strong> Avoid clicking on links or opening attachments from unknown or unverified sources. Hover over links to preview the actual URL and verify it before clicking.</li>
      <li><strong>Verify Requests for Sensitive Information:</strong> If you receive a request for personal or financial information, verify it through trusted contact methods before providing any details.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Engineering Tactics:</strong> Be aware that attackers may try to manipulate individuals into providing confidential information by exploiting trust or creating a sense of urgency. Always question requests that seem out of the ordinary or involve sensitive data.</li>
      <li><strong>Training and Awareness:</strong> Participate in regular security awareness training to stay updated on the latest phishing techniques and learn how to identify potential threats.</li>
    </ul>
